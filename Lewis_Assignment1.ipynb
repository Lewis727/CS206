This behavior is completely normal in the Frozen Lake environment because it simulates a slippery surface. Also, this behavior represents an important characteristic of real-world environments: the transitions from one state to another, for a given action, are probabilistic. For example, if we shoot a bow and arrow there’s a chance to hit the target as well as to miss it. The distribution between these two possibilities will depend on our skill and other factors, like the direction of the wind, for example. Due to this probabilistic nature, the final result of a state transition does not depend entirely on the taken action.\n",

        "1.   We shall first understand the components present in the Frozen Lake environment. The environment is the frozen lake displayed as a grid map with each grid having a state (frozen, hole, goal). With different state, the agent may receive rewards or punishment as it makes a move. On the other hand, the agent receives observations as it interacts with the frozen lake environment, that is, making a move. With the dichotomy of environment and agent, we can experiment with the Froze Lake environment in the following ways. By the setting of this environment, the agent's action space must be discrete. But we can change the environment by adjusting the probability of \"slipping\" and observe how it affects the agent's behavior. We can also experiment RL algorithms, such as Q learning, SARSA, and TD3, etc. By changing adjusting the environment and the agent's learning strategy (algorithm), we can experiment with the Frozen Lake environment in openAI gym by the dichotomy of environment and agents.  \n",
        "2.   To write markdowns professsionally, it is very important to use headings to have a clear structure with different levels (e.g., heading 1, heading 2,etc.). Also, to leverage the advantage of writing markdowns over plain texts, it is common practice to utilize various formatting to enrich content. Adding reference hyperlinks, italicize or bold certain words, and adding images or bullet points are all effective ways to increase the readability of code and communicate core ideas to the reader. As for code formatting, writing comments and proper documentation are of crucial importance to let others know the functionality of a piece of code by explaining the meaning of functions, variables, and loops, etc.\n",
        "3. Writing this tutorial in Jupyter Notebook with markdowns and code formatting significantly increased the communication efficiency and interactivity, compared to plain text stories. First, by mixing code cells and markdowns, we are able to break down steps and explain code in vivid details. Second, a good story should be clearly structured. In the case of the *Frozen Lake Experiment*,  the author introduces the environment, stochastic vs. deterministic, maps, and conclusion. Third, the use of images and insertion of hyperlinks not only make this more visual but also give readers more references if they are interested. Moreover, the code comments make the code more understandable."
